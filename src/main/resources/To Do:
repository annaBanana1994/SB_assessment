Pick up after Christmas notes:

when making calls to client this is not the correct date format required
threeWeeksAgo.toEpochMilli()
Desired format is: 2020-01-01T12:34:56.000Z
Figure out how to get that
Needs to be correct in 3 places
-This would also change logic in RoundUpService, try and neaten up
-This might make checking if been over a week simple


Check the Responses from client, change to Object and map to node

TESTS!!!!!!
